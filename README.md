# M-O-R-S-E

M-O-R-S-E is a simple Python project that converts between plain text and Morse code. It provides functionality to translate messages from plain text to Morse code and vice versa, supporting all lowercase letters of the alphabet.

## Features

- Convert plain text to Morse code.
- Convert Morse code to plain text.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **main.py**: This is the entry point of the application. It provides a simple menu for the user to select whether they want to convert plain text to Morse or Morse to plain text.
- **module.py**: This file contains the conversion logic for transforming plain text to Morse code and vice versa.

## How It Works

### Plain to Morse

The `plainToMorse()` function takes a plain text message as input and converts each letter into the corresponding Morse code. Each letter is separated by a space, and the spaces between words are represented by `.....` (5 dots).

### Morse to Plain

The `morseToPlain()` function takes a Morse code sequence as input and converts it back to plain text. It assumes each letter is separated by a space, and word boundaries are marked by `.....`.

### Morse Code Mapping

The Morse code for each letter is predefined and hardcoded in the **module.py** file. For example:

- `a`: `._`
- `b`: `_...`
- `c`: `_._.`

And so on for all letters of the alphabet.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/M-O-R-S-E.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd M-O-R-S-E
   ```

### Running the Program

To run the program, simply execute `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Usage

Once you run the program, you'll be presented with a menu to choose between two options:

1. Convert a plain text message to Morse code.
2. Convert a Morse code message to plain text.

- If you choose option 1, enter your plain text message, and the program will output the corresponding Morse code.
- If you choose option 2, enter a Morse code sequence (with letters separated by spaces and words by `.....`), and the program will convert it to plain text.

### Example

**Plain to Morse:**
```
Input: hello
Output: .... . ._.. ._.. ___
```

**Morse to Plain:**
```
Input: .... . ._.. ._.. ___
Output: hello
```

## Code Overview

### main.py

This file handles the user input and calls the appropriate functions to perform the conversion.

```python
def main():
    menu = input("1) Plain to Morse\t(or)\tMorse to Plain\nenter choice either 1 or 2: ")
    if menu == '1':
        plainToMorse(input("Enter your message: "))
    elif menu == '2':
        morseToPlain(input("Enter Morse: "))
```

### module.py

This file contains two main functions: `isAlphabet()` and `morseToPlain()`, which handle the character-by-character translation between plain text and Morse code.

For example, the letter `a` is translated to `._` using the `isAlphabet()` function:
```python
def isAlphabet(a):
    if a == 'a':
        return "._"
    # Rest of the alphabet mapping
```

The reverse conversion from Morse to plain text is done by the `morseToPlain()` function:
```python
def morseToPlain(traverse):
    if traverse == "._":
        return 'a'
    # Rest of the Morse to alphabet mapping
```
